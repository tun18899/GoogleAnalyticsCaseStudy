# DivvyBikeCase
## Introduction
-Scenario: I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing team asked us: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?", so we can design a new marketing strategy to convert riders into annual members. Our team will create report with compelling data insight and professional data visualization.

-Cyclistic has a flexibility pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
   **Note: Cyclistic is a fictional company and the dataset is used for completing the study case **

## Characters and teams
-Cyclistic: A bike-share program in Chicago that offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes.

-Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and  manager, who is responsible for advertise bike-share program.

-Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. 

-Cyclistic executive team: a detail-oriented team that will decide whether to approve the recommend marketing program.

  <center>**To answer the question, we will stick to data analytics process, according to Google(ask,prepare,process,analyze,share,act)**</center>


## Ask
-Our business task is "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?". At this step since we don't have data yet, using SMART (specific, measure, action-oriented, relevant, time-bound) to ask Lily(stakeholder) why does she think that would be a good idea. 

-Top question would be "top 5 features difference", "Most important difference", "Is it worth it?", "What will happen in near future?".

-To solve this problem, determine how long do member/casual use bike a day and what day is that would be a key factor, since we want to track each type of riders closely day by day. 

## Prepare
-Now we have data, we can begin to analyze and identify trends  [All Cyclistics trip data in previous 12 months](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

-Above  is an html files with all excel sheets, we will choose last 12 months in 2022

-This dataset is appropriate to the purpose of the study case, and has been make available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

-To ensure data integrity, make sure to convert values into correct data types, and most importantly check **spelling** after we add another new fields.

-Since we having data now and verify, we can move to next step of the process.

-**Warning**: brace yourself because we will have to deal with large dataset and make sure to save after every step since it is very easy to crash.

## Process

-I used Mac, so after analyzing excel sheet I have to convert from .numbers to .csv to further analyze in R 

-To make sure data is clean and integrity, data types must be correct, and use conditional formatting to fill out blank cell,also sort out columns especially
"membercasual" columns since we need them to solve business task

-I follow steps that was suggested, by calculated "ride_length" column by subtracting end_time with start_time, then format into hh:mm:ss, and "day_of_week" column by convert start_time into weekday.

## Analysis

-Now we will begin to analyze data, after we calculate "ride_length" and "day_of_week" column, sort them out, and check out data format(day_of_week is"weekday" and ride_length is "time").

-Then I began to create a pivot tables, to calculate average ride_length for member and casual, day_by_week and number_of_rides.

-After analyzed all 12 excels sheet, the ride_id columns has the first letter either numeric or characters, same as start_station_id and end_station_id. There is also situation that rider used bike for few seconds or none(Lily we need to talk about this?)

## Act
-After a lenghtly investigation and based  on data we have, our conclusion would be: Member riders have more rides and less ride time than casual. The most number of rides are during first and midweek, while the most average ride time are on weekend.

-My top 3 recommendations are:

   + Since we have more members riders than casual ones, we don't really need to do anything else since everyone is doing great, I would rather recommend giving annual anniversary gift to members in our program, so they could stay longer.
   
   + Because casual have spent more time on bike, I would recommend a first-time purchases bonus, so they can have all benefits from long-time membership with lower fee for first year
   
   + To wrap up, many people have days off on weekend, so create a meeting/club that member/casual people can join together, to make connection and create a healthy lifestyle. The more casual joins, the more chance they would likely to buy a membership.
   

## The end
